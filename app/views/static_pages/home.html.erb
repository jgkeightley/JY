		<h1>YOUR VISA</h1>
		<p>
			If you wish to operate a business or work in Australia you will need the correct visa. You 
			will find the Australian Government website <a href="http://immi.gov.au">www.immi.gov.au</a> a very helpful starting point 
			for your enquiries. If you wish to apply for a visa you can use a Registered Migration Agent 
			for your application or apply personally. Migration agents operating in Australia must be 
			registered with the Office of Migration Agents Registration Authority.

		<h1>GETTING STARTED</h1>
		<p>
			Before starting a business you need to decide what type of entity you wish to use to operate 
			your business. The choices are: sole trader, partnership, private company or trust. This choice 
			is important as income tax law and business law apply differently to each of these entities. 
			You will also find that there are taxes in Australia which do not exist in France and vice-
			versa so you will want to have a basic understanding of how Australian taxation might affect 
			your business.

		<h1>BUSINESS SUCCESS</h1>
		<p>
			Most importantly you will want to know the likelihood of your business being a success in
			Australia. As your customers will be mostly Australian your understanding of what works in
			France may not be a good guide to what will bring you success in Australia. It will pay you to 
			familiarise yourself with what is available here and how your product or service might appeal 
			to Australians.
